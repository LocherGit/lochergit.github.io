# Honesty

The nature and essence of honesty is something I do not fully grasp and the concept kind of scares me. In my personal understanding, being too honest is indistinguishable from being sincere. Sincerity in itself is to bare yourself and your thoughts infront of others regardless of the outcome, regardless of eventual repercussions. There's even a proverb about this:

_Act honestly and answer boldly._

I do feel like honesty as a concept severely condemns me as a person. It's not like I have anything to hide but the act of displaying myself as honest is frankly terrifying, like a breach of privacy that I myself made possible.

Well, just the fact that I express my thoughts about this matter makes me seem like an insincere and dishonest person, right? Though it can simply be that I have no recollection of my sincere and honest character trait, which makes it all too sad.

Actually, I am not all too bothered about this. It's simply a thing I've noticed about myself and I tried to put them into readable chunks of words in order to have some kind of reconsideration with myself. It's not like my personality will suddenly rot upon realization that honesty is something it could never express.

I do feel like being honest is something everyone should strive to be, at least more than currently. And yes, I am preaching even though I was not being honest with myself so far. It builds character, and it builds _meaningful relationships_.

At the same time, _because_ there are honest people, myself and other dishonest persons can fit in the blanks during communication. Leading a conversation with an honest person is much easier instead of a person with a muddy expressionism because intention and expectaction are written on their faces most of the time.

And because I tend to be flexible in expressing myself, I can fit in the blanks with whatever they would expect me to say and we both go our merry ways. That in itself can be assumed to be a conversation talent, I guess? But truthfully, it's just another way of saying I am dishonest.

I trained a lot to hold conversations with topics I have no backing information on. I failed plenty of times but I think I am decent enough to not let it show. I just don't want the facade the crumble up and create an awkward silence which could ruin the happy and friendly conversation.

In any case, if I ever come across an honest person, I pray to whatever being high in the sky that this person will not be exploited sooner or later. Protect them at all costs!

## Tips on how to hold conversations without much self-input

- Listen and understand the intent behind the topic at hand (everything is told with an intention).
- Either recall the name of the topic as a response in order to deepen the topic (you will seem to be in deep thought) or ...
- Ask about a simple thing within the topic spectrum to steer the topic away from the current direction and/or introduce a new topic.
- Keep your conversation partner entertained, either express a shallow interconnection statement (a subjective fact that cannot be easily refuted) or
- Bring in a sudden interruption to completely halt the flow of the conversation (swift hand gesture to fix posture or asking for a beverage refill).
- In both aforementioned interruptions, it is understandable to rewind the topic at hand and at the same time it serves as a subtle trick to receive a summary of the topic by the counterpart himself.

It's much simpler to hold a conversation if the conversation partner is proficient in holding conversations himself because then you have a better feel of the conversation flow, what topics are covered and what topics are going to be further introduced in subcontext.

Dishonest expressionism works because you have no loyalty to yourself, you simply let yourself be moved by whatever force effects you.

I strayed from the topic but alas, just do your thing and you'll be fine.
