            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>
              Following the sudden explosion at the international research facility which is located on an island inbetween the nation of Berbora and the federation of
              Gonder, a nameless man was found washed ashore on a coast near the federation's capital city Langley. After being rescued and cared for at a nearby dojo of
              that city, the man decided to practice the teachings of the dojo and to find out the origins of his identity, not knowing that by doing so he will get
              involved in matters far greater than a simple personal crisis.
            </p>
            <p>
              Donning the garment of the night and equipped with a mysterious power that he has yet to understand, the nameless man embraces the name of 'Locher' as he
              encounters the shady and peculiar personae of the underground society led by Alabaster Bandit and his right-hand man Doomfinger. However, Locher is not
              alone in his endeavor as he incidentally finds himself surrounded by a comparable group of unique people like the helpless gunner named Nussknacker and the
              old but very accomplished Schimmelheimer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Will Locher be able to prevail as he takes charge against the men of the underground and will he be able to handle the truth in regard to the explosion of
              the international research facility which is not entirely unrelated to his current circumstances?

            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>
              In a fantasy world where magic beasts and sorcery was commonplace, humanity had just managed to enslave demonic beings to do their biddings. Used as war
              tools, they were made to possess the body of human children that could then be controlled and monitored with the use of drugs and hypnosis in the form of
              conditioned inhibition. A demon with a human host possesses regenerative abilities and can manifest its unique and powerful demon chants.
            </p>
            <p>
              August Henke was an accomplished inquisitor of the religious but corrupt state of Briona. During the Inquisitor Expulsion Act, he was met with the death of
              his wife and a mortally wounded son. Unable to accept the cruelty of fate, the overly pious Henke decided to summon a demonic being and bound it to his
              son's body, hoping that the infusion of demonic power might prevent the all but assured death. Though his son averted death, he now became the very being
              that stood against the foundation of his religious beliefs - a rational yet clueless demon child with the name 'Kindle'.
            </p>
            <p>
              'If God brings salvation to all beings - does he speak of angels, humans and demons alike?'
            </p>
            <p>
              As fugitives on the run, Henke is now accompanied by a demon with the face and body of his son. Will he be able to accept Kindle as his flesh and blood
              while salvaging what little is left of his son's consciousness or will he be forced to kill the being that has rooted itself deep in the heart and mind of
              his son? Henke's ideals on righteousness and human morals are put to the test as Kindle's untainted view on life slowly uncovers the untold history of
              humankind.
