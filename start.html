        <h2>"Delighted to meet you."</h2>
        <p>
          I am the creator of this github page though the content you will stumble upon is mostly not really about me as a person but rather about
          things I would like to be interrelated with.
        </p>
        <p>
          My hope for this place is to not have it become a journal or blog that is periodically updated but a platform where I can just share some
          things and, if possible, not bore the visitors.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Think <span>I Am</span></h2>
        <p>
          You would not believe how hard it is to come up with something to write about, especially if it is this kind of self-evaluation. I am
          nearing my 30th birthday, so I am often regarded as the friendly and eccentric grandpa who is easily excited about literally anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is why it is not surprising that the constantly changing dynamic of the tech world would utterly fascinate me. Not only that, I have a
          bad habit of dipping my feet into anything that grabs my attention: the mere existence of this website here is proof enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          Partially in order to find ways to leave something of worth behind, I took extensive care to invest my time in many different fields to
          produce results of tangible relevance. This includes making music, creating simple games, authoring some stories and writing functional
          code.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Think <span>I Like</span></h2>
        <p>
          I am a vivid reader of novels because I like being somewhere I am physically not and doing things I have yet to find courage in trying. More
          in line with what you would expect from seeing this page, I am also using my programming knowledge to create something that is unusual,
          quirky and fulfilling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other than that, I am just a blank slate like everybody else - waiting to be filled. I would like to believe that even an old dog can still
          be taught how to create responsive web applications and engaging games that leave players with more than just the credits sceen.
