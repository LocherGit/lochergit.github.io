Yggdra Union is a tile-based tactical role-playing game which has a unique battle system that is enriched with the Union feature. Contrary to other games of the same genre such as Fire Emblem, Tactics Ogre and Advance Wars, the Union feature helps to chain multiple battle together and the battle participants are all decided by their position relative to the battle initiator.

Either way, the way how the units are entering the battle screen and how they are clashing with the enemy with their own specific battle theme playing in the background really engages me. As it is also possible to take out the head of the squad during the battle entrance makes you unconsciously move your joystick towards the enemy as some kind of placebo ritual. You would do the opposite whenever the enemy is initiating the battle, purely out of fear of your squad leader being taking out by surprise. This behavior is akin to some placebo rituals that people do whenever they throw a Pokeball in the hopes of catching the Pokemon.

Grandia is a role-playing game series with a turn based battle system. The uniqueness comes from actions being played in real time on a dynamic battlefield. Even though the game flow is paused whenever a character is asked for an input, the player needs to account for several factors when choosing their options: The character's movement speed, attack speed, distance to the enemy, the enemy's current action meter and the enemy action itself. Conquering the battle system will result in exploiting the system which makes it possible to endlessly deny actions of the enemies while comboing one's own actions onto each other for a massive damage increase.

The most satisfying feeling of accomplishment occurs whenever a player successfully cancels the enemy's action. During the brief time period after the enemy chose their action and before the execution of the chosen action, the player is able to hit the enemy with an offensive skill or critical attack which will cancel the enemy action and push them back to the waiting period before being able to choose another action. For this occurence to happen, the player needs to time the character's action beforehand and hope for the character pathing (which cannot be set by the player) to line up. The Action cancelling can also happen to the playable characters so the battle turns into a cat and mouse game of trying to cancel each other's actions.

Golden Sun 1&2's battle screen is a true marvel to look at, especially considering that the displayed information was perfectly and completely visible on a Gameboy Advance screen.  
The game series is especially memorable for the distinctive use of sound effects which turns the navigation of menus into a sort of rhythmic dance and the visual queues. The visual effects for combat actions also deliver the necessary smack of impact perfectly. As an example, the character briefly flashes white during damage calculation with a very distinctive sound effect. This sound effect is used for every instance of damage and this is true for enemies as it is true for the playable characters. 

Physical damage that is directly received will trigger a noticable knockback and the camera pans around to show the point of view of the attacker while the background image is just a wide image shifting around with a parallax effect. The apparent simulation of depth and perspective helps in terms of immersion.

I am a big sucker for raw group fights with people beating up on each other and the Last Remnant offers such an experience with its unique and also revolutionary (my opinion) take on squad battle management system. Instead of straight commands that do not feel very immersive, you give a broad stratagem to the entire squad in order to shape the battlefield, engage the proper enemies and have the squads support each other in close vicinity. You can organize the squads to have their own purpose and have them position themselves accordingly, then you can also customize the squad members and their talents and equipment so that they fulfill their individual role inside of their respective squad. The configuration effort is quite demanding and the lessons required to conquer the battle system is deep and complex. 

In return, it offers the kind of war strategy vibe that appeals to my goober smooth brain whenever things go as planned or things end well that was not planned at all. This game at a glance seems chaotic but there is a surprising amount of excitement just from watching how a battle can transition from situation to situation, from turn to turn. The panning in on the individual members performing their moves makes them seem alive, and gives them a personality that is unlike other RPGs where you just watch the combat action being executed that you had handpicked from the menu.
