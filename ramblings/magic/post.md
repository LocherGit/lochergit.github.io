> **Words are Truth, Words are Power**

Have you ever thought about Magic in a more sophisticated way? What is magic? How does it work? Can its rules be perceived, inferred and then enforced?  
In this rambling, I will try my utmost to talk about systematic magic, the engineering aspect of invocating spell formulas and the overall basics of spellcrafting.

## Magic as a System
### Magic Spell
A spell is what I consider a spelling of Magic. This means in the world of Magic you can invoke a Magic Spell purely by spelling it out. **Words are truth, words are power.**  
Words consist of syllables and words have an origin (as in: basis), context and variation. With all of these aspects considered, you can probably construct a magic spell by learning about how to utter a magic spell by use of syllables.

Let's think about it in a different way. Did you ever wonder what makes magic so powerful? What is it about the act of *channelling* a magic spell? What makes it take so much longer than a simple spell? What does the spellcasting person do? I doubt it's simply them "charging the spell up" like a Son Goku while clenching their fists and showing their teeth and anger. A wizard's greatest assets lie in memorization, mental construction and honed mental processing facilities. So I believe the channelled spell is simply a magic utterance that consists of much more syllables than an ordinary magic spell.

Yet here is the thing: What could possibly happen inside of the uttered extra syllables? To draw a comparison to human speech, expressing a state with few syllables result in a broad and abstract expression. For example the concept of **fire**. What kind of fire? Where? How hot is it? Does something happen alongside the fire? Although short and concise concepts help to establish the theme but everything else is interpreted by the perceiver. The effect is lessened but the perception is still there. I believe this is the case with magic as well. The potency of a magic spell lies in its explicitness: the more directed and descriptive the spell, the more powerful it becomes.  

### Effect Anchoring and Spell Targetting

So how do you direct a spell? You can't expect to point with a finger or wand and say "Fire, here!", right? Or is it actually possible? Let's try to think about it in a more scientific way as if something like Magic Engineering truly existed. When Magic is invoked, it's out of the control of the spell caster. *Fire and Forget*, I guess. Therefore I believe we are dealing with two different ways on how to direct spells:
- A physical anchor or medium needs to exist that is placed at the location where the magic spell should take effect. I've read eastern publications where the concept of anchoring is often used, either to anchor a spirit to physical objects or to anchor the effect of occult magic to a specific area. Once the anchor has been set, the syllable-expression of the anchor is then used inside of the magic utterance. A conversation with a tour guide during my travels through asia gave me an amusing answer to a question I had: What kind of anchors do people typically use in rituals or how to decide on where to build temples and do they have to fulfill certain requirements? To that he admitted that they either used some specific ornaments or also very random items, especially money and coins. The reasoning being that those are items of which they knew how to specify when praying. The concept of money, coins and heaven existed for millennia and arguably existed since the dawn of humanity. Maybe this is why word of mouth managed to retain some of these terms to be used for incantations and prayers. Of course he may had been just lying but this claim somehow sticked with me up until now.
- In eastern fantasy media, it is often described that during the incantation of the spell, they direct the spell using the flow of magic. Many simple spells are not targeted as they are merely invoked at the *most likely* spot to manifest itself. The concept of environmental mana is often spoken about; a formless invisible energy source that exist as long as life itself exists. So either the spell is targeted using a wand that expels mana towards whatever the spell is supposed to target towards, or the action of pointing is directly expressed inside of the magic utterance. "Fire, follow wand". Something like that perhaps? I believe this also aligns with the former method of anchoring, but in that regard the syllable-encoded expressions in concern to locality was not lost in time. A wizard could therefore perfectly describe the place they want the spell to hit in a precise utterance and parameterize it in a given magic spell. Or maybe precise utterance is not entirely the right way to describe it and it is more about the abstract description of the spell target. Do you perhaps remember the Arithmetician job in Final Fantasy Tactics? This unique spell casting class could invoke powerful magic that is incapable to differentiating from friend and foe, and its targetting is purely governed by abstract rules given by the spell caster that follows a system grounded in math. I believe this is the same with magic that is invoked onto the target, which is often a space in reality. If this is true, what does this say about the effective range of the spell and can its invoked origin be tracked? The thought is horrifying and spells become scaringly effective assassination tools.

### Spell Parameterization
If we were to decode a magic spell to its very components, we would likely find the origin of the magic spell. This basic utterance is nothing more than a theme, a concept, a wish. Other than that, what would we be able to find? In my opinion, I believe the magic spell is made out of a spell origin and a handful of utterances that I would like to describe as parameters. An utterance is an item of meaning, a term of purpose, an element of power. It could mean anything and it could represent everything. I hate to be vague but to be honest magic is a vague fantasy concept to begin with so please bear with my rambling. Basically the more parameters a spell invocations has, the more descriptive the spell becomes and its effect is more profound and powerful. But the construction of a descriptive spell takes time because it basically requires the spell caster to chain multiple parameters in succession in order to produce a coherent magical utterance that is meaningful, truthful and powerful.

### Spell Tribute
With that out of the way, let's talk about spell tributes. In games, we commonly refer to it as the **Mana Cost** of a spell. In a logical sense, reality is governed by the law of equivalent exchange. It's not possible for something to exist without something else to tribute for its existence. At least that's what my brain currently tells me. Let me phrase it in another way. If something like mana truly exist, then magic should used it as fuel, no? Right now I am battling with several hypothesises as to how this cost is actually being paid:
- Due to my assumption that human vocal cords cannot utter mana infused syllables for a magic utterance to be invoked, I believe that magic is actually an environmental resource that is sucked into the place of the spell target. In that regard, does the invocation of mana require mana? I believe the amount of it should be smaller than where the spell is ultimately being casted to. Think of it as a match that is required to light straw on fire. Once the spell is in effect, the surrounding mana is continously sucked into the magic spell in order to keep the magic spell going. I believe this concept also aligns to eastern practices. Who pays the tribute for the effect over a specific area? Most likely a being that consists of mana being anchored to that place, yes? Or maybe a periodic ritual that is masked as a religious event but in reality exists purely to fuel the ongoing spell effect. My mind tells me that we are treading in dangerous and risky topics so I better stop right there.
- My second assumption that all beings have innate mana even though most of them are either unaware of having it or unable to utilize it. It's like humans being unable to effectively use the blood that flows in their veins. There is no apparent use for it, they gamble with their life when they do it and they are at risk of losing their lives if they use too much of it. I believe the same can be said with mana. Human vocal cords can't utilize mana, or maybe they do but we live blissful to this fact. Either way, this hypothesis is naturally employed in video games as characters have life and mana points. In some cases, mana also correlates with the mental condition of the character and causes characters to fall unconscious if their mana is completely spent. If a spell caster is unable to cast magic, this is then purely explained by them having insufficient mana to invoke it. Even though mana exists in every living being, mana is said to also exist in the environment. The thing however is that mana disperses easily, therefore it is not possible to directly use the environmental mana as spell tribute. The aspect of spell channelling with that context in mind is less about construction a complex magic formula but more about increasing the environmental mana to be used as spell tribute because one's own mana reserves are deemed insufficient.
- Lastly, let's think about some crazy what-ifs. What if magic is paid by none other than reality itself? There is no environmental mana, no mana inside the body of all beings. With the universe and our reality slowly breaking down, the entropical trend goes towards expelled magic being taken by the void. Something exists that ceases to exist when magic is expelled. It may be called mana, but it does not behave exactly like mana. To avoid misconceptions, let's call this overworldly resource *matter* instead. Matter that matters, and matter that ceases to matter. Humanity and all beings on earth are free to use magic as it is seemingly in endless supply because the matter that is used to fuel the invocation exists in another plane of reality altogether. With such an understanding, some sci-fi stories would gain merit as human waged wars expend matter in a disproportional rate that may exhaust matter in a way that brings attention to a being that comes to correct the state of reality (and most likely wipe humanity's existence in the process).

Either of those hypothesises could be closer to the truth and I believe the concept and relation of mana and magic should align with the fantasy world that would want to employ them in a meaningful and logical way.

### How does media portray the use of magic?
- Nearly all works of media portray the use of magic differently. For some, magic is a simple on and off skill that can be triggered on command and requires no active guidance. It is as if the magic guidance system is completely replaced by mere eyesight. Magic as a system and tool is regarded as self-evident and natural in those scenarios, therefore it is not often described how the inner workings of magic spell handling is functioning.
- In media, spells are often learned and taught to by a mentor or system. If we take this consideration to its extreme, when was the spell originally constructed and where did the failed attempts led to? For all spells involved, the spell power is affected by the "magic skill" of the spell caster, which is often just another say of expressing the imposed reality that "more mana = more power".
- In some manga and light novels, magic is taught in school with the openmindedness to claim that "original spells" exist. This introduces the concept of spell tinkering and also takes into the account the concept of spell parameterization. A spell does not necessarily need to exhibit the same effects every time it is invoked. By use of restructuring the basis of a spell, original spells are created that exhibit different effects and phenomena than its unaltered version. A so-called spelling mistake will backfire onto the spell caster with the amount of utilized magical power (mana) that is practically activated but without an outlet or direction to flow towards. This leads to the interpretation that undirected and pure mana is an energy form that is by its nature unstable and prone to combust into a mana explosion.
- I have zero recollection in hindsight but I remember reading about magic actually being utilized as a system to overwrite reality with engineered phenomena. In that case, the Magic Utterance would be structured entirely different. Instead of explicitly expressing concepts such as "Fire", it's more about describing the overwrite that will cause an altercation in reality, which is then forcefully mended by use of some entropical power which results in reality and the spell effect taking place at the same time. An example of such a spell-phenomena is "Freezing Temperature+Distance+Direction+Range". The concept of freezing temperature is applied at the position of choice which is then picked up by the governing reality which tries to correct itself. The procedure of correction validates the phenomena effect as an event that actually happened which mends the reality of freezing temperature into a mended existence in the real world that can no longer be denied. This workaround behavior itself is considered practical magic that can be exploited to "invoke desired phenomena onto our real world by use of the world's tendency to mend irregularities".

## Magic Engineering
After describing the system that may govern the field of magic, let's talk about magic as an engineering practice, the procedure of theoretical magic invocation and logical concepts of flash-casting and multi-casting. This topic is quite technical and requires a bit of openmindedness and it deals with concepts outside the realms of humanity. Even with that in mind, I hope you can still follow my rambling along to its ultimate conclusion. Truth be told, my rambling follows no logic other than my own...

The truth of the matter is, the world of magic is still haunted by so many basic questions which require answers or else many concepts end up being built on top of an uneven foundation.  
*How do you utter magical syllables? How many syllables does a magic spell consists of? What kind of rules does it follow?*  
The following chapters will attempt to describe a system that helps to explain the anatomy of a magic spell, followed by concepts in regard to facilities capable of voicing mana-laced utterances and listing techniques on how to cancel the invocation of a magic spell. Last but not least, I will explain the theory behind constructing invocations that cannot be cancelled by the techniques I will mention although this does not mean that all invoked spells retain their effectiveness just because they were successfully invoked.
