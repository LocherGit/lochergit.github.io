# Sense for visual aesthetics

To be completely honest, I think my sense for visual aesthetics is pretty _crap_. It goes even farther than my designs just looking unconventional - that is to say that my designs defy any kind of functionality or practicability. I always knew that something was wrong with the way I estimated and envisioned my design choices yet at the same time I always believed that this is something that can be learned or trained.

In one of the jobs where I was working on implementing websites, maintaining and updating their designs and themes and also communicating with my clients, I clearly realized that the designs that I envisioned for them differed greatly from what they had in mind.

Of course I am not yet at a level where my decision could have any negative impact for the company, but it's alarming enough for me to contemplate my taste and how it could become this withdrawn from any kind of norm.

Actually, I came to work for this particular company with the intent to train my artistic eye in order to discern design choices and to align my personal inclinations to that of the working professionals who were employed by the company. Of course my tasks were not limited to frontend matters only but there were also tasks for backend and server administration.

Now after 4 months of working and helping out, I don't feel like I've grown at all. Infact, I feel like I came to understand the certain style of standard web design a bit more, yet I find myself slipping back to the cozy hole of my habitual design thinking.

At first I clashed with others on topics of envisioned web design for our clients where we had full freedom over implementing our wishes. I couldn't keep up with their reasonings because I could not yet ascertain what web design cores we had to respect to have a website running and completely functioning at the same time.

The designs I came up with were flawed and crippled, they lacked impact and also it was unfeasible to have them properly maintained for longer periods of time. Yeah, not that it's any different now, but I feel like what I made some months ago couldn't even compare to the stuff I come up with today.

In the end, the designs of mine are still vulgar, quirky and strange. Yeah, didn't I learn anything while I worked at that company? Truth be told, I learned how i could create pages that were quirky and _just like me_ and yet fulfill most of the requirements to function properly. That's why I am not as concerned anymore. It's what I make of it.
